I am a dedicated Software Engineer with 2 years of experience and a diverse skill set.
I possess proficiency in Unity and Godot, complemented by a solid understanding of technologies such as C, C++, C# and .NET.

Known for being proactive, honest, and direct, I excel in decision-making and have a keen attention to detail, especially in technical aspects. My primary areas of interest include Infrastructure Software, Cyber Security (Red Team), Operating Systems (Linux & Embedded Linux), and Game Development.

I daily drive Bazzite Linux, a custom image built upon Fedora Atomic Desktops. My enthusiasm for technology extends to Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) and Open-Source Hardware (OSH).
Driven by a desire for excellence, I am commited to continue evolving as a developer.
