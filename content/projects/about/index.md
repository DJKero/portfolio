I am a dedicated Software Engineer with 2 years of experience and a diverse skill set. I possess proficiency in Unity and Godot, complemented by a solid understanding of technologies such as C, C++, C# and .NET.

I daily drive Bazzite Linux, a custom image built upon Fedora Atomic Desktops. My enthusiasm extends to Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) and Open-Source Hardware (OSH). Driven by a desire for excellence, I am commited to continue evolving as a developer.
